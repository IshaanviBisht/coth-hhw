                Turn on Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Wherever Possible! <br> 
                Even if someone gets your password, 2FA adds a second lock. 
                This could be a code sent to your phone or an app like Google Authenticator. 
                Set it up for your email, social media, cloud storage, and any other important accounts.

                Don’t Share Photos with Metadata! <br> 
                Photos taken with phones often include location data (EXIF metadata). 
                And if you upload before removing it then you might be revealing your real address and personal information!
                Before uploading, remove metadata using a free tool like <a href="https://jimpl.com/remove-exif/">Jimpl Metadata Remover</a> or disable location tagging in your camera settings.

            <p>
                Hover Before You Click — Especially on Short Links! <br>
                Hover over links to preview the real URL. Be extra careful with shortened links (like bit.ly). If the link looks suspicious, don’t click it. 
                Use websites like <a href="https://checkshorturl.com/">CheckShortURL</a> to see where it really leads.

                Review App Permissions Every Few Months!
                Some apps silently collect your data. (Mostly for showing personalized ads.)
                Go into your phone or Google/Microsoft account settings and review which apps have access to your contacts, camera, location, etc. 
                Remove anything unnecessary.

                Don’t Reuse School Email for Personal Sites! <br>
                To all my fellow 21kians or online schoolers, please don't do this! 
                Don't ever use your school email for signing up to other unrelated websites such as social media or games.
                Remember it will be delated once you graduate your class, and school emails are for educational purposes, use another email address for those stuff!

            <p>
                Search for Yourself Online (Trust me!!) <br>
                Google your full name, username, or email once a month. 
                You’ll be surprised what’s public. 
                If you find old posts, images, vidoes or literally anything that you don’t want online, take steps to delete or hide them.
